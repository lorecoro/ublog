After cloning the repository, run `npm install` from the root folder; then the back-end app can be started with `npm start` and express listens by default to port 8080.

# FE Setup
Enter the /fe folder and run `npm install`; then the front-end app can be built with `npm run-script build` from the /fe folder, and the generated files go into the /fe/build folder.
